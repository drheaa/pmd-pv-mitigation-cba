# LV PV Integration and Mitigation using PowerModelsDistribution

This repository contains research code for analysing the impact of high rooftop PV penetration on low-voltage (LV) distribution networks, and for testing mitigation options such as STATCOMs, SOPs, and batteries.

The work is exploratory and research-focused, and is intended to replicate and extend a D-Suite-style (https://www.spenergynetworks.co.uk/userfiles/file/D-Suite-D1.3-Report-Cost-Benefit-Analysis.pdf) from SP Energy Networks, planning workflow using unbalanced AC optimal power flow (OPF).

This project is being developed as part of a student research project and is not production-grade software.

## Motivation

High penetrations of rooftop PV can create operational challenges in LV networks, including:

- voltage rise above statutory limits  
- phase unbalance and high Voltage Unbalance Factor (VUF)  
- spatially localised congestion near the end of feeders  

Distribution planners typically address these issues using power-electronic devices (e.g. STATCOMs, SOPs) or energy storage.

This project aims to:
1. quantify PV-driven congestion in realistic LV feeders  
2. identify where and why violations occur  
3. evaluate the technical effectiveness of mitigation devices  
4. compare mitigation options using a simple cost–benefit framework

## Scope of the study

The project follows this workflow:

1. **Baseline modelling**  
   - Unbalanced LV feeder with customer loads only  
   - AC OPF used to compute voltages and unbalance  

2. **PV integration studies**  
   - Rooftop PV added at customer buses  
   - PV penetration increased to create stress scenarios  
   - Voltage and VUF congestion identified  

3. **Congestion identification**  
   - Voltage magnitude violations  
   - VUF violations  
   - Spatial congestion regions along feeders  

4. **Mitigation modelling**  
   - STATCOM placement and sizing  
   - SOP modelling  
   - Battery-based mitigation  

5. **Cost–benefit analysis (CBA)**  
   - Comparison of mitigation options under identical stress scenarios

## Tools and methods

- Julia  
- PowerModelsDistribution.jl  
- JuMP + Ipopt  
- Unbalanced AC OPF (IVR / explicit neutral formulations)  

The focus is on **planning-level analysis**, not real-time control.

## Repository structure (high level)

- `data/` – raw and processed datasets  
- `configs/` – scenario definitions and modelling assumptions  
- `src/` – reusable modelling, metrics, and plotting code  
- `scripts/` – runnable analysis stages (baseline, PV, STATCOM, etc.)  
- `results/` – figures and tables generated by each stage  

Each analysis stage writes structured CSV outputs so downstream stages can run without manual intervention.
